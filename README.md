# Stacklands Extra Search Mod

Lets you right click on a Card and search for all Ideas that use the Card as component.

- Right Click on a Card to add the Cardname into the search textfield.
- Press **F** to toggle between the searchmodes.
  - **Title Search**, goes through the Ideas and displays all that contain the searched Term in the Title. (original Search)
  - **Description Search** (activated by Default), displays all Ideas that contain the searched Term in the Idea description.

Because it searches through the description, there might be some Cards that dont use the searched Card as component but uses the name in the flavour text description.

## Development

- uses the Stackland [mod-template](https://github.com/stacklandsdev/mod-template) as basis
- Build using `python build.py` in the mod root folder
